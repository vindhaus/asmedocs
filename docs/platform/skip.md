title: Conditionally Skip Paper to Final Round
parent: Platform Customizations
---

**Description**

A job checks for papers that have the phrase "Video Presentation" in the title, and then checks if there is a round after the Final Papers round. If the paper has this phrase in the title, and there the round after Final Papers exists, then the job will skip said paper through the rounds to the very last one. Usually, this last round is called "Video Presentation," "Presentation" or something similar.

**Purpose**

ASME has many video-only submissions in their conferences that are only relevant to video/presentation-only rounds. Before, they had to manually skip papers through rounds. This feature automates that work completely.
