**Description**

AlphaTrust is a third-party integration/vendor used by ASME to manage copyright agreements. The integration primarily exists in Extender.

---

**Purpose**

In order for submitters to register or submit final papers for ASME's conferences, they have to sign a copyright agreement with ASME. Once the agreements are signed by the submitters, they will be logged in the Extender as having signed. This will satisfy one of the conditions which will allow the submitter to upload papers to the Final Papers round for which ever conference they're participating in.

---

**Requirements**

- The AlphaTrust integration is enabled by default on the backend.

---

**Troubleshooting**

The AlphaTrust integration does not require troubleshooting most of the time, if at all. There may be some troubleshooting of the features built in our system that use the AlphaTrust workflow (see: Related Integrations section below.)

   - If ASME does raise a bug ticket regarding the AlphaTrust integration itself, it will be important to ask for an example API request/response from AT, as a starting point. 
   - From time to time, AlphaTrust will have software updates that require them to whitelist an email account in order to continue access to their API. If this is requested, provide the requestor with integrations@getopenwater.com
