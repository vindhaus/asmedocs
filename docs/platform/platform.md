## Platform Customizations

Much of ASME's customizations are to the platform itself. Some are independent changes that exist solely within the main platform and some rely on the Extender application to work, push data to or pull data from. If the module primarily exists within the main platform, it will be documented in this section. Please refer to the table of contents below.
