**Public API**

Accessing ASME's information through the API is the same as other clients. You will only need one Client Key in order to access all of their data. The API key can be obtained in the platform, through System Admin's User Profile. API information below:

- Base URL: {update when moved to an internal repo}
- Client Key: {update when moved to an internal repo}
- API Key: {update when moved to an internal repo}

**Extender API**

ASME's Extender API is not publicly exposed. Any issues arising from this API will have to be raised in the AsmeExtension repo, as only a developer can access it. More likely than not, ASME will not be raising tickets of this nature. Issues surrounding the Extender API will be seen internally first.

TODO: Find out if there's a list of custom variables that are easily accessible through the platform.
