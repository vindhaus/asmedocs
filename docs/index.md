## Welcome to the ASME/OpenWater documentation!

ASME is a large client for OpenWater (OW). The breadth of their requirements made it necessary to do a slew of customizations to the OW platform so they could integrate their operations successfully with our product. This documentation will lay out all of the custom modules we have created for them.

Typically, there is one project manager assigned to ASME at a time. They are the primary contact and coordinator for the ASME project; gathering requirements, drawing up technical specifications and shepherding the items to completion. Aside from these tasks, they will also submit bug reports, mediate between development and the client, and act as general support.

In the event that the project manager assigned to ASME is not available and questions arise around any custom ASME module, consider this document the authoritative guide. Any updates and changes to this document should fall on the assigned project manager to make. Requests for updates can be sent to the currently assigned project manager; contact details are below:
